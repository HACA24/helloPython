# this program takes in two numbers and provides the result of adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing them
a = input ("please enter the first number: ")
a = int(a)
b = input ("please enter the second number: ")
b = int(b)

# this is showing me how to convert integer into a string and grouping them together
print("Addition: " + str(a+b))
print("Subtraction: " + str(a-b))
print("Multiplication: " + str(a*b))
print("Division: " + str(a/b))
